🔥 Fun Facts About Me:
I love working on side projects that push the boundaries of what technology can do.
I believe in building not just code, but solutions that make an impact **socially** and **sustainably**.
When I'm not coding, you can find me reading books on AI, tech trends, or tinkering with new gadgets (**romantasy** is a must!).
